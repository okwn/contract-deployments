# contract-deployments

This repo contains execution code and artifacts related to Base contract deployments, upgrades, and calls. For actual contract implementations, see [base/contracts](https://github.com/base/contracts).

This repo is structured with each network having a high-level directory which contains subdirectories of any "tasks" (contract deployments/calls) that have happened for that network. Supported networks are `mainnet`, `sepolia`, `sepolia-alpha`, and `zeronet`.

## Setup

### Toolchain (mise)

All required tooling (Foundry, Node.js, Bun, Go) is pinned in [`mise.toml`](mise.toml) so that every contributor — and especially every signer — runs identical versions. This eliminates a class of bugs where domain separators, build artifacts, or generated signatures differ between machines.

1. Install [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html). On macOS the simplest path is:

   ```bash
   brew install mise
   ```

   Then follow the [shell activation instructions](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise) for your shell (e.g. add `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` to `~/.zshrc`).

2. From the repo root, install and activate the pinned versions:

   ```bash
   mise trust    # one-time, approves this repo's mise.toml
   mise install  # downloads pinned foundry, node, bun, go
   ```

3. Verify Foundry is on the pinned version (currently `1.5.1`):

   ```bash
   $ forge --version
   forge Version: 1.5.1-...
   Commit SHA: b0a9dd9ceda36f63e2326ce530c10e6916f4b8a2
   ```

   The `Commit SHA` is the source of truth — it must match the commit pinned in `mise.toml`. The `Version` suffix may differ (`-stable` vs `-v1.5.1`) depending on which release artifact you installed; both are built from the same source.

Once `mise install` has run, `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `bun`, and `go` will all be on the pinned versions whenever you `cd` into this repo (assuming `mise activate` is set up in your shell).

### Running a task

To execute a new task, run one of the following commands (depending on the type of change you're making):

- For a generic task: `make setup-task network=<network> task=<task-name>`
- For gas increase tasks: `make setup-gas-increase network=<network>`
- For combined gas, elasticity, and DA footprint gas scalar tasks: `make setup-gas-and-elasticity-increase network=<network>`
- For fault proof upgrade: `make setup-upgrade-fault-proofs network=<network>`
- For safe management tasks: `make setup-safe-management network=<network>`
- For funding tasks: `make setup-funding network=<network>`
- For updating the partner threshold in Base Bridge: `make setup-bridge-partner-threshold network=<network>`
- For pausing / un-pausing Base Bridge: `make setup-bridge-pause network=<network>`
- For switching to a permissioned game and retiring dispute games: `make setup-switch-to-permissioned-game network=<network>`
- For pausing SuperchainConfig: `make setup-superchain-config-pause network=<network>`

Each `setup-*` command also creates a matching `<network>/signatures/<task-dir-basename>/` directory for [task origin signing](#task-origin-signing). The parent `signatures/` directory is created automatically via `mkdir -p` for networks that do not yet have one.

Next, `cd` into the directory that was created for you and follow the steps listed below for the relevant template.

Please note, for some older tasks (that have not yet been adapted to use the signer tool) you will need to manually create validation file(s) for your task as they are bespoke to each task and therefore not created automatically as a part of the templates. We use one validation Markdown file per multisig involved in the task, so if there's only one multisig involved in your task, then you can simply create a `VALIDATION.md` file at the root of your task containing the validation instructions, while if there are multiple multisigs involved in the task, then create a `validations/` sub-directory at the root of your task containing the corresponding validation Markdown files. If you need examples to work from, you can browse through similar past tasks in this repo and adapt them to your specific task. Also, please note that we have tooling to generate these files (like the `task-signer-tool`) which removes the manual aspect of creating these validation files, we will soon update these instructions to reflect how this process can be automated.

## Network configuration

Each network directory (`mainnet/`, `sepolia/`, `sepolia-alpha/`, `zeronet/`) contains a `.env` file that defines all contract addresses and network metadata for that chain. These variables are automatically available to every task via the `include ../.env` directive in each task's Makefile, so there is no need to manually load addresses in individual tasks or templates.

The network `.env` files contain:

- **Network metadata** — `NETWORK`, `L1_RPC_URL`, `L2_RPC_URL`, `L1_CHAIN_ID`, `L2_CHAIN_ID`, `LEDGER_ACCOUNT`
- **Admin addresses** — multisig addresses, proposer, challenger, batch sender, etc.
- **L1 contract addresses** — proxy admin, bridges, dispute game factories, system config, etc.
- **L2 contract addresses** — fee vaults, cross-domain messenger, standard bridge, etc.

All address variables are prefixed with `export` so they are available to child shell processes (Forge scripts, shell commands, etc.). Foundry scripts can access them via `vm.envAddress("VARIABLE_NAME")`.

> **Note:** If you need to add or update a contract address, edit the corresponding `{network}/.env` file directly. Do not create per-task address definitions unless they are truly task-specific.

## Directory structure

Each task will have a directory structure similar to the following:

- **records/** Foundry will autogenerate files here from running commands
- **script/** place to store any one-off Foundry scripts
- **src/** place to store any one-off smart contracts (long-lived contracts should go in [base/contracts](https://github.com/base/contracts))
- **.env** place to store task-specific environment variables (contract addresses are inherited from the network-level `.env`)

## CI — Template Validation

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically validates all 10 setup-templates on every pull request and on pushes to `main`.

**What CI checks for each template:**

1. **Solidity formatting** — `forge fmt --check script/` ensures formatting consistency.
2. **Compilation** — `forge build` verifies that imports resolve, types are correct, and all dependencies are present.

Templates are validated in parallel using a matrix strategy, so failures are isolated per-template with clear error messages identifying the template and failure type.

**How it works:**

- All tooling (Foundry, Node, Bun, Go) is installed by the [`jdx/mise-action`](https://github.com/jdx/mise-action) GitHub Action using the versions pinned in [`mise.toml`](mise.toml), so CI matches local signer environments.
- For each template, the corresponding `make setup-*` target creates a task directory from the template.
- `make deps` installs all dependencies (including base-contracts at the commit pinned in the template's `.env`).

**What CI does NOT do:**

- Does not run `forge script` (requires RPC URLs, env vars, and hardware wallets).
- Does not run `forge test` (no test files exist in templates).
- Does not run signing or execution targets (they depend on network state and hardware wallets).

> See [`.github/workflows/validate-templates.yml`](.github/workflows/validate-templates.yml) for the full workflow definition.

## Multisig macro convention

All task templates use global macros defined in [`Multisig.mk`](Multisig.mk) for multisig operations:

| Macro              | Purpose                                                        | Key arguments                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MULTISIG_APPROVE` | Approve a transaction (nested safe hierarchy)                  | `(address_list, signatures)`                                   |
| `MULTISIG_EXECUTE` | Execute an approved transaction onchain                       | `(signatures)`                                                 |
| `GEN_VALIDATION`   | Generate a validation JSON file for signers via the signer-tool | `(script_name, safe_addr, sender, output_file, env_vars)`     |

Two helper macros are also available for tasks that need nonce offset calculations or address manipulation:

| Macro        | Purpose                                                 | Key arguments    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `GET_NONCE`  | Fetch the current nonce of a Safe contract onchain     | `(safe_address)` |
| `ADDR_UPPER` | Convert an address to uppercase (for env var construction) | `(address)`     |

Signing is handled externally by the [task-signing-tool](https://github.com/base/task-signing-tool).

Every template Makefile should include `Multisig.mk` and define at least two variables for the macros to work:

```makefile
include ../../Makefile
include ../../Multisig.mk
include ../.env
include .env

RPC_URL = $(L1_RPC_URL)       # or $(L2_RPC_URL)
SCRIPT_NAME = MyScript         # class name or .sol file path
```

Templates that generate validation files should use `GEN_VALIDATION` with the `deps-signer-tool` prerequisite (which checks out and installs the signer-tool):

```makefile
gen-validation: validate-config deps-signer-tool
	$(call GEN_VALIDATION,$(SCRIPT_NAME),,$(SENDER),base-signer.json,)
```

Templates should use these macros rather than inline `forge script` / `eip712sign` / `bun run` invocations. The known exceptions are the incident-response pause templates, which pre-sign 20 future nonces in a loop using inline `eip712sign`; only their `execute-*` targets use `MULTISIG_EXECUTE`.

## Task origin signing

The root Makefile provides three targets for generating cryptographic attestations (sigstore bundles) that prove who created and facilitated a task. These are inherited by all task Makefiles via `include ../../Makefile`.

| Target                         | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `make sign-as-task-creator`    | Attest authorship of the task (run after setup)  |
| `make sign-as-base-facilitator`| Attest Base team facilitation                    |
| `make sign-as-sc-facilitator`  | Attest Security Council facilitation             |

Signatures are stored in `<network>/signatures/<task-name>/`, where `<task-name>` is auto-derived from the task directory name. This directory is created automatically when you run any `setup-*` target (in both the root and Solana Makefiles), so it is ready for the signing tool when you invoke one of the targets below. Two variables control this behavior and can be overridden in a task's Makefile if the defaults are not appropriate:

| Variable        | Default                                           | Description                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `TASK_NAME`     | `$(notdir $(CURDIR))` (directory basename)        | Name used to locate signature dir  |
| `SIGNATURE_DIR` | `$(CURDIR)/../signatures/$(TASK_NAME)`            | Directory where signatures are stored |

All three targets depend on `deps-signer-tool`, which checks out and installs the [task-signing-tool](https://github.com/base/task-signing-tool) automatically.

## Using the incident response template

This template contains scripts that will help us respond to incidents efficiently.

To use the template during an incident:

1. Fill in the `.env` file with dependency commit numbers and any variables that need to be defined for the script you're running.
1. Delete the other scripts that are not being used so that you don't run into build issues.
1. Make sure the code compiles and check in the code.
1. Have each signer pull the branch, and run the relevant signing command from the Makefile.

To add new incident response scripts:

1. Any incident response-related scripts should be included in this template (should be generic, not specific to network), with specific TODOs wherever addresses or other details need to be filled in.
1. Add the relevant make commands that would need to be run for the script to the template Makefile
1. Add relevant mainnet addresses in comments to increase efficiency responding to an incident.

## Using the generic template

This template can be used to do contract calls, upgrades, or one-off deployments.

1. Specify the commit of [Base contracts code](https://github.com/base/contracts) you intend to use in the `.env` file
1. Run `make deps`
1. Put scripts in the `script` directory (see examples that are part of the template, for example, there is a file `BasicScript.s.sol`). See note below if running a task that requires a multisig to sign.
