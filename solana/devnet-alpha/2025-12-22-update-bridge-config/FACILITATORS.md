# Facilitator Instructions: MCM Bridge Config Update & Program Upgrade

## Overview

As a Facilitator, you are responsible for:

1. Creating the bridge config update proposal
2. Preparing the bridge program upgrade buffer
3. Creating the upgrade proposal
4. Merging both proposals into a single MCM proposal
5. Committing and pushing the merged proposal to the repo
6. Coordinating with Signers
7. Collecting signatures
8. Executing the merged proposal onchain

## Prerequisites

```bash
cd contract-deployments
git pull
cd solana/devnet-alpha/2025-12-22-update-bridge-config
make setup-deps
```

Ensure you have:

- Rust toolchain installed
- Solana CLI installed and configured
- Anchor CLI installed
- Bun installed
- `mcmctl` installed (via `make deps`)
- `eip712sign` installed (via `make deps`)
- A funded Solana wallet configured

## Phase 1: Create Bridge Config Update Proposal

### 1.1. Update .env for config update proposal

Set the following in `.env`:

```bash
# RPC configuration
SOL_RPC_URL=<rpc-url>

# MCM configuration
MCM_PROGRAM_ID=<mcm-program-id>
MCM_MULTISIG_ID=<multisig-id>
MCM_VALID_UNTIL=<unix-timestamp>
MCM_OVERRIDE_PREVIOUS_ROOT=false  # or true if needed
MCM_PROPOSAL_OUTPUT=proposal.json

# Bridge config parameters
BRIDGE_PROGRAM_ID=<bridge-program-id>
BRIDGE_PARTNER_ORACLE_REQUIRED_THRESHOLD=<threshold-value>
```

### 1.2. Generate config update proposal

```bash
make step1-create-set-partner-oracle-config-proposal
```

This creates `set-partner-oracle-config-proposal.json` with the SetPartnerOracleConfig instruction.

### 1.3. Review config proposal

Open and review `set-partner-oracle-config-proposal.json` to verify:

- Bridge program ID is correct
- Partner oracle required threshold matches intended value
- Valid until timestamp is appropriate

## Phase 2: Coordinate with Signers and Collect Signatures

Coordinate with Signers to collect their signatures. Each Signer will run `make sign` and provide their signature.

Concatenate all signatures in the format: `0xSIG1,0xSIG2,0xSIG3`

Once you have all required signatures, add to `.env`:

```bash
MCM_SIGNATURES_COUNT=<number-of-signatures>
MCM_SIGNATURES=0xSIG1,0xSIG2,0xSIG3
```

## Phase 3: Execute Merged Proposal

### 3.1. Add execution variables to .env

Add the following variables to `.env`:

```bash
AUTHORITY=<your-wallet-keypair-path>
```

### 3.2. Execute the proposal

```bash
make step3-execute-proposal
```

This command executes all the necessary steps:

- Initialize signatures account
- Append signatures
- Finalize signatures
- Set root
- Execute both operations (config update + program upgrade)

## Phase 4: Verification

### 4.1. Verify config update on Solana Explorer

Visit the Solana Explorer for your network:

- Mainnet: https://explorer.solana.com/
- Devnet: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
- Devnet-alpha: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom&customUrl=<devnet-alpha-rpc>

Search for the execution transaction and verify:

- The transaction was successful
- The program logs show `Instruction: SetPartnerOracleConfig`
- The partner oracle required threshold was updated correctly

### 4.2. Verify program upgrade on Solana Explorer

Search for the bridge program address (`$PROGRAM`) and verify:

- The "Last Deployed Slot" is recent
- The upgrade authority is still the MCM authority
- The program was upgraded successfully

### 4.3. Update README

Update the Status line in README.md to:

```markdown
Status: [EXECUTED](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/<transaction-signature>?cluster=<network>)
```

Replace `<transaction-signature>` with the execution transaction signature and `<network>` with the appropriate cluster (devnet, devnet-alpha, mainnet-beta, etc.).
